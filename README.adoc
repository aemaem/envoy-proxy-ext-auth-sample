= Sample Envoy proxy with external authentication

1. `docker compose build`
2. `docker compose up`
3. `curl -i -L localhost:8080/` -> OK `{"title":"The index page"}`
4. `curl -i -L localhost:8080/lenny` -> NOT_FOUND `{"detail":"Not Found"}`

As can be seen in the logs below, the configured authentication is called with the same path as the request is.
